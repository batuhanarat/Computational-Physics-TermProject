'''
(b) You can find observational data from many low-temperature WDs in the file white dwarf data.csv.
4 Two quantities are listed for each WD: mass (in solar masses MâŠ™), and base-10 logarithm of the surface gravity
in CGS units (log(g)). The latter can be easily converted to radius using basic Newtonian gravity.
Write a function to read this data, and show all the points in an M vs R plot using solar masses and
average Earth radii as units. Note that this is a .csv file, so reading it with
    Python might be a bit different from reading a plain ASCII file which was the case for
        the Hubble data in the problem sets.
